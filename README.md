K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the simplest supervised machine learning algorithms.
By using the KNN algorithm I have made predictions of two projects:
1.The iphone purchase project is about Wheather the customer will purchase or not.
2. The Bangalore house price project is about to predict the estimating prices of bangalore houses based on their features.
